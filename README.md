# IC_tester-awesome-project-with-AVR-atmega-
AVR projects

I love this project because it solves a big problem , if you have an IC and don't know it's name or ID this project  is coming.

# File contains:
* CODE___.rar (has code for this IC)
* SIM___.rar  (has simulation for this IC in proteus)
* datasheet.pdf

# Hint:
- we added some ICs but you can add any number and make this project more powerful

# Tested ICs:
* 74141_IC
* 74145_IC
* 74147_IC
* 74148_IC
* 74150_IC
* 74151_IC

# Steps of building:
---build our powerful driver to get any pin in controller with IC pins
-read some data about each IC (form PASCAL file)
-tested in proteus
